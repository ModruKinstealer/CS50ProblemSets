introduction
    just a brief paragraph about me. Maybe a picture.. maybe.
Hobbies
    D&D - complete
        Things I might like to include:
            link to WotC - complete
            Link to Foundry- complete
            Link to 3.5 and or 5.0 SRD - complete
            Maybe link to D&D beyond- complete
            links to some good D&D streams on twitch/youtube - complete
                Critical Role, Godforged, the one by Sherlock Hulmes
            Recent tweets from SageAdvice/Eric Crawford- complete
    Reading
        List of favorite Authors/series
            Links to recent tweets (if they have one)  - pushed to v2 due to time constraints
            link to their home page - complete
            Link to their socials - complete, where available
            Link to their youtube/twitch channel(s) - Complete where available
                 if they have one with a link to their last video - pushed to v2 due to time constraints
        What I'm reading now - Complete
            admin ability to update easily?  - pushed to v2 due to time constraints
            Maybe link to the amazon/GoodReads page of the book - Complete
                Does either have an API to allow you to link the blurb for the book? - pushed to v2 due to time constraints
    Playing Video Games
        List of recent games played
            admin ability to update easily? - pushed to v2
        link to a page describing game (maybe steam page?)  - pushed to v2
            It looks like some of the stuff I wanted to do for the games page requires a key for Steams API, to get one you need a domain name which I don't currently have so they'll have
            to wait until later.
    watching movies
        List of favorite movies
        Maybe a list of all movies I've watched with a rating for each - pushed to v2
            admin ability to quickly add a movie - pushed to v2
        link to it's IMDB page, and teaser if possible
            https://imdb-api.com/api#SearchTitle-header
            https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/online-movie-database/
    Woodworking
        List of projects
        links to some good youtube channels
            maybe individual videos

SQL db to handle the data?

Maybes/future additions
    -maybe each page can have a place where people who visit can add their favorite book/movie/game/etc
    -If link is broken email me?
    -Some sort of database like structure, either sql or json probably, when content grows
    -Define the *_link sidebar css to be defined programmatically rather than having an entry for everything to make it easier if you add links in the future.
    -Better way to handle footer rather than having it pasted to each page?
    -better way to handle the CSS for placing the sidenavs to programmatically do it rather than setting individual numbers
        Should be possible with some kind of foreach style loop and keeping track of starting, last, and current "buttons"
        -Pushed to V2 due to time constraints

Design ideas
Menu accross the top (home/about, D&D, Reading, Games, movies, woodworking) - Complete
Would be cool if the list of books or whatever is along the side and you click and it slides out and fills the page with the relevant info.
Background for each page change based on what book/movie/game etc is clicked to be that of the cover art or whatever? - pushed to v2 due to time constraints

Look at notes from html/css course to make sure getting the appropriate accessibility stuff and what not.
