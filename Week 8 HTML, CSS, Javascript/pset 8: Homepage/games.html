            I've been into gaming for basically my whole life. We started out with a Texas Instrument that ran programs off a cassette tape, went to an IBM clone that had dual 5.25"
             floppy drives. If you don't know what those things are, it's not you, it's me, I'm old. At any rate more serious gaming started with the original Nintendo and Sega systems
             up to the Sega CD. After that I realized they were just going to keep iterating and I'd have to buy a whole new console and games every time so I switched to PC gaming and haven't
             seriously looked back, I did try a Wii as I thought the bowling and what not looked fun with the new style controllers.  I played Everquest for... I don't know 20 years; I own like 23
             expansions. Tried out WoW and Dark Age of Camelot, Star Wars the Old Republic, Anarchy Online. Doom and Quake of course, who didn't play those back in the day?
        </p>

            Over the years I've pretty much gravitated to RPGs, survival, and Sandbox style games, I'm not too good at First Person Shooters and the player base for those types of games are just generally too
            toxic for my tastes. It started out with Centurions, defender of Rome, Warcraft II, Starcraft, Diablo, those kinds of games. The original Final Fantasy. Eventually Minecraft came along
            and I played that for a while. I've been on a Sandbox builder game kick for the most part since whether it was Ark or Conan Exiles, Starmade and Space Engineers, and more recently 7
            day to Die and Empyrion Galactic Survival. I've dabbled in other Genres, whether it was Overwatch, For Honor, etc. but many of those games are just more fun when you're playing with friends
            rather than strangers so I don't typically play them for very long.

            The lists below are mostly notable games that I enjoyed and a bunch of them I have invested considerable time into them. There are a bunch of other games I played but don't have a ton of
            time into or that I haven't played in a long time, that kind of thing. Hopefully the games listed below will spark some interest for others, maybe you'll find one you haven't heard of that
            ends up being a game you enjoy playing. If you know of a game similar to the ones down below that you I'd enjoy feel free to email me.
